🚀 Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying an ECS Service Using the AWS Web Console
This guide walks you through deploying a public-facing ECS service using AWS Fargate (serverless) via the AWS Web Console. We will: ✅ Create an ECS cluster ✅ Define a task definition ✅ Deploy an ECS service ✅ Set up auto-scaling (optional)

🛠 Prerequisites
	•	AWS account with access to ECS, IAM, and networking
	•	A container image (e.g., a public image like nginx or your own ECR image)

1️⃣ Create an ECS Cluster
	1	Go to AWS Console → ECS
	◦	Open the ECS Console
	◦	Click "Clusters" in the left sidebar
	◦	Click "Create Cluster"
	2	Choose a Cluster Type
	◦	Select "Networking only (AWS Fargate)"
	◦	Click "Next step"
	◦	Enter Cluster name (e.g., my-cluster)
	◦	Click "Create"
✅ Cluster Created!

2️⃣ Create a Task Definition
	1	Go to AWS Console → ECS → Task Definitions
	◦	Click "Create new task definition"
	2	Select "Fargate"
	◦	Click "Next step"
	3	Define Task Settings
	◦	Task definition name: my-task
	◦	Task role: Leave as default
	◦	Task execution role: Select ecsTaskExecutionRole (or create one)
	4	Set Task Size
	◦	CPU: 512 (.5 vCPU)
	◦	Memory: 1024 (1 GB)
	5	Add a Container
	◦	Click "Add container"
	◦	Container name: my-container
	◦	Image: Use nginx (or your own ECR image)
	◦	Port mapping: 80 (container) → 80 (host)
	◦	Click "Add", then "Create"
✅ Task Definition Created!

3️⃣ Create an ECS Service
	1	Go to AWS Console → ECS → Services
	◦	Click "Create service"
	2	Select Launch Type & Cluster
	◦	Launch Type: Fargate
	◦	Cluster: Select my-cluster
	3	Select Task Definition
	◦	Task Definition: my-task
	◦	Revision: Latest
	◦	Service name: my-service
	◦	Number of tasks: 2
	4	Configure Networking
	◦	VPC: Choose an existing one
	◦	Subnets: Select at least one public subnet
	◦	Security Group: Allow inbound traffic on port 80
	5	Configure Load Balancing (Optional)
	◦	Choose "Application Load Balancer (ALB)"
	◦	Select an existing ALB or create a new one
	◦	Register the ECS tasks to the target group
	6	Review & Deploy
	◦	Click "Create Service"
✅ ECS Service Created!

4️⃣ (Optional) Enable Auto Scaling
	1	Go to ECS → Services → my-service
	2	Click "Auto Scaling" → "Update"
	3	Enable "Service Auto Scaling"
	4	Set Scaling Policy
	◦	Choose "Target Tracking"
	◦	Metric: CPU utilization
	◦	Target value: 50%
	◦	Min tasks: 2, Max tasks: 10
	5	Click "Update"
✅ Auto Scaling Configured!

🎯 Verify Deployment
	•	Check Running Tasks: ECS → Cluster → my-cluster → Tasks
	•	Find the Public IP:
	◦	If using a Load Balancer: Copy ALB URL from EC2 → Load Balancers
	◦	If no ALB: Get the task’s public IP from ECS → Tasks

🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully deployed an ECS service using AWS Fargate! 🚀
